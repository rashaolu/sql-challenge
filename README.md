# Project Description 
## For this project I designed tables that holds data from 6 CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data.

## This project utilizes data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. 

## An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the Tables was created using QuickDBD.
